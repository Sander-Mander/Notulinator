# Notulinator

A free AI-based tool to make minutes of audio recordings. Very useful for secretaries who want to save themselves some time! The script is structured in such a way that even people without coding experience should be able to run it. Notulinator supports audio files of multiple hours and uses the fast [WhisperX](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX) AI model to quickly generate a transcription.

The button above links to the Notulinator Google Colab file. This file contains detailed step-by-step instructions on how to use the Notulinator. Google Colab is a service that hosts code online, which saves the hassle of having to run the code on your own computer. Additionally, Google provides you with a free GPU, which is necessary to run the Notulinator. Note however that you can only use the GPU for a limited time per day (often ~3 hours). Happy minute-making!
